# xcalc
Simple Calculator with Python GUI (TK)is a vanity Python project by Ebenezer Obasi (www.eobasi.com).
It should enable you do basic calculation such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, but should it fail, just know it's my first Python GUI program.

See my motivation here >> http://www.eobasi.com/first-python-gui-progam-xcalc

If you happen to find this program or the source code useful, feel free to use as you see fit.
